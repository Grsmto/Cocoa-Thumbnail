Cocoa-Thumbnail
===============

Create thumbnails from external images on iOS

If you want to be able to create thumbnails from remote images files directly on your application, instead of generating thumbnails from remote, this is for you.
Simply copy/paste the category "UIImage+Thumbnail" in your project and you are gone.
